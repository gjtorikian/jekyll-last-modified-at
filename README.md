## Setting up

Add the following lines to your site's `_config.yml` file (for Jekyll 3.5.0 or newer):

```yml
plugins:
  - jekyll-last-modified-at
```

With previous Jekyll versions you need to add the following lines instead:

```yml
gems:
  - jekyll-last-modified-at
```

## Usage

There are a few ways to use this gem.

You can place the following tag somewhere within your layout:

``` liquid
{% last_modified_at %}
```

By default, this creates a time format matching `"%d-%b-%y"` (like "04-Jan-14").

You can also choose to pass along your own time format. For example:

```liquid
{% last_modified_at %Y:%B:%A:%d:%S:%R %}
```
That produces "2014:January:Saturday:04."

You can also call the method directly on a Jekyll "object," like so:

``` liquid
{{ page.last_modified_at }}
```

To format such a time, you'll need to rely on Liquid's `date` filter:

``` liquid
{{ page.last_modified_at | date: '%Y:%B:%A:%d:%S:%R' }}
```

(It's generally [more performant to use the `page.last_modified_at` version](https://github.com/gjtorikian/jekyll-last-modified-at/issues/24#issuecomment-55431108) of this plugin.)
